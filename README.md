# Fruit Classification ML Methods
 We will make a fruit classification algorithm using prototyping, KNN and Neural Networks
 
 a. Learning by Prototypes: A class prototype is the mean of the training examples of that class. To classify a test image, find the prototype with the shortest distance.
b. K-Nearest neighbor classification: Find K nearest neighbors (in the training set) of the test image and output the majority vote.
c. Multi-Layer perception

we will use the Fruit 360 dataset https://www.kaggle.com/moltean/fruits (Links to an external site.) or https://github.com/Horea94/Fruit-Images-Dataset   (Links to an external site.)which has 131 classes.
